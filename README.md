# Police-Shooting-Fatality

## Background

This project began as a group assignment as part of a data science competition in UCLA Statistics 101C, Intro to Statistical Models and Data Mining. Professor Akram Almohalwas assigned three original datasets to use, with about 30% missing data overall, but allowed teams to use whatever outside data we could amass using City or State as foreign keys. The assignment was to predict victim Fatality from any of the 70+ variables, using whatever models we could use to extract information from the categorical and numeric variables. 

However, after a poor competition performance (though I still got an A in the class), this project became a personal vendetta for me to settle. I simply couldn't sit still knowing that other teams had achieved a higher classification acurracy than my group, when I knew that my group had busted its butt for the classification score we did get (officially, our score was 84%)

Therefore, a month after the competition ended, I reopened this cold case, and started the project over from scratch. Much of the data cleaning code for significant variables was reusable; still, I wanted to give all variables a fair second chance to make the final cut, so after double checking all variables, good and bad, I performed feature selection on the entire batch. Additionally, I imputed used a different package to compute variables,
