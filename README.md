# Police-Shooting-Fatality

## Background

This project began as a group assignment as part of a data science competition in UCLA Statistics 101C, Intro to Statistical Models and Data Mining. Professor Akram Almohalwas assigned three original datasets to use, with about 30% missing data overall, but allowed teams to use outside data as well. The assignment was to predict victim Fatality from any of the 70+ variables, using whatever models we could use to extract information from the categorical and numeric variables. 

However, after a poor competition performance (though I still got an A in the class, woohoo), this project became a personal vendetta for me to settle. I simply couldn't sit still knowing that other teams had achieved a higher classification acurracy than my group, when I knew that my group had busted its butt for the classification score we did get (officially, our score was 84% classification accuracy)

Therefore, a month after the competition ended, I reopened this cold case, and started the project over from scratch. Much of the data cleaning code for significant variables was reusable; still, I wanted to give all variables a fair second chance to make the final cut, so after double checking all variables, good and bad, I performed feature selection on the entire batch. Additionally, I imputed used a different imputation package, then re-ran my models. 


## Goal

Predict victim fatality from 76,000 violent police encounters from 32 cities nationwide. 

## Phase 1  -*Group Project*-

Working with three other Stats majors at UCLA, this first phase of the project was pivotal to the speed of my success in phase two. As the project was both a competition and a course requirement, my group and I completed several tasks, along with the overarching goal. Our step by step process was as follows: 
### Step 1: Merge all Data Tables
### Step 2: Clean Data
### Step 3: Impute Data
### Step 4: Add new Data
### Step 5: Modelling
### Step 6: Present Findings/Results of all previous steps in front of class

## Phase 2  -*Solo*-
